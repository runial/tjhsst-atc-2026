# TJ ATC
This is the website for the Assistive Technology Club at TJHSST, one of the top high schools in the U.S. Our mission is to help and connect others through assistive technology, whether that be through ATConnect (our flagship event), yearlong projects, or weekly meetings. You can visit our website at [tjatc.org](https://tjatc.org). If you have any questions or inquiries, please contact us at info@tjatc.org.

The website is currently maintained by Richard Tang (TJHSST '28).
